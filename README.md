# Turkic Mythology-Themed Blockchain (Simple Demo)

This project is a **Turkic mythology-inspired blockchain network**. It follows the fundamental principles of blockchain while incorporating mythological figures and a unique cryptocurrency called **Tamag**.

## 🔥 Core Concept

### 🏛 Blockchain Structure

- The first block (**Genesis Block**) is created by **Kayra Han**.
- Each block contains a hash of the previous block, ensuring a secure chain.
- Transactions are verified and added to the blockchain through mining (**finding the Kut**).

### ⚔ Mythological Transactions

- Transactions are conducted by legendary Turkic figures such as **Ülgen, Erlik Han, Kayra Han, Asena, and Börteçine**.
- Example: **Ülgen sends 100 Tamag to Erlik Han**, and this transaction is recorded on the blockchain.

### ⛏ Mining (Proof of Work)bir

### 🌐 Decentralized Network

- Multiple nodes operate in parallel to maintain decentralization.
- Nodes communicate and synchronize, always adopting the **longest valid chain**.

## ⚙ How It Works

1. The program initializes three independent **nodes**.
2. Nodes establish peer-to-peer connections.
3. Mythological transactions are submitted.
4. Mining begins, and the blockchain updates as new blocks are added.

## 📌 Summary

This is a **decentralized blockchain system**, but instead of traditional cryptocurrency models, it is built around a **Turkic mythology-inspired economy**. Every element—from transaction initiators to mining terminology—draws from ancient Turkic beliefs while maintaining a **fully functional blockchain architecture**.
